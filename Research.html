					<p style="text-align: justify;  color: black">My Current and past research is centered upon the broad theme of inorganic functional nanomaterials. 
						On an elaborate note, I ‘make’ the materials through wet-chemical synthesis, ‘see’ them through electron microscopy, 
						‘explore’ their structural and electronic properties through first principle simulations, and ‘apply’ them in suitable applications. <br>
					
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my belief, this combinatorial approach is quite powerful for solving materials problems. 
					The fun lies in the fact that sometimes computation leads to guided experiments, and sometimes it helps to understand experimental data. 
					The experimental approach involves interrogation of materials of interest at atomic-scale through aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). 
					And the computations involve atomic-scale simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Given a judicious choice of systems, 
					these two techniques are truly complementary and are quite useful to establish structure-property relationship in functional nanomaterials.
					Doing this needs rigorous training in chemistry, aberration-corrected STEM and DFT simulations, along with access to wet-chemistry labs, and super-expensive
					instruments such as AC-STEM and supercomputers.     
					<br>
					
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of materials, currently I am looking into functional oxides, chalcogen (Te & Se) and metal  (Au and Pt) nanowires.
					Application of such structure-property relationship in these functional nanomaterials ranges from nanoscale electronic devices to macroscale regular devices, catalysis, energy conversion and storage.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> PtCu Alloy Nanoparticles on reduced SrTiO<sub>3</sub> for Preferential CO Oxidation (PrOx)</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/STO-PtCu.jpg" align="left" style="width: 35%; height: 35%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Preferential Oxidation of CO in excess H<sub>2</sub> is an industrially important reaction for Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). 
												Usually, commonly employed pure Pt nanoparticles are costly and they undergo severe poisoning  by CO and has a high affinity to adsorb H<sub>2</sub> which is the fuel in the cell.
												To avoid this, alloying Pt with a base-metal is a commonly adopted strategy, but achieving and characterizing such alloying at the nanoscale is extremely challenging.<br>
												
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, using a facile microwave based technique, PtCu alloy nanoparticles were nucleated on reduced-SrTiO<sub>3</sub> support for the PrOx reaction. 
												Using SuperX EDS detector based on ChemiSTEM technology in a probe-corrected FEI TITAN G<sup>2</sup>, the alloying was characterized , and the hybrid catalyst was employed for the PrOx reaction at typical operating temperatures of PEMFcs. 
												Adsorption–desorption experiments established the strikingly different CO adsorption behavior of bimetallic PtCu compared to monometallic Pt nanoparticles on support. 
												Through thorough characterization and catalytic studies, a trend in the selectivity and stability of CO conversions over the SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-supported PtCu alloy catalyst was established.<br>

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Two-Dimensional SnSe<sub>2</sub>-graphene Hybrid for Photodetection</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/snse2-g.png" align="left" style="width: 35%; height: 35%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;"> Photodetection with low band-gap semiconductor SnSe<sub>2</sub> suffers from low carrier mobility. 
						This can be circumvented using graphene based hybrid device structure, which demands a flat 2D interface. 
						Using solution chemistry, we have devised a way to control the growth of SnSe<sub>2</sub> with a flat 2D morphology. 
						DFT simulations rationalize our synthesis strategy showing very different adsorption behaviour of capping agents in the SnSe<sub>2</sub> growth medium. 
						Graphene-SnSe<sub>2</sub> hybrid device (with <a href="http://www.physics.iisc.ac.in/~arindam/" style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration:none">Quantum Materials & Devices Group, Physics, IISc</a>) shows a photoresponse of ~10<sup>10</sup> Jones, 
						at par with state-of-the-art photodetectors. Thus, with engineered chemistry, it was possible to devise a dropcast-based state-of-the-art 2D-heterostructure fabrication for photodetection.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Phase and Morphology Tailored Electrochromicity in Nanoscale WO<sub>3</sub></p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/toc-wo3-ahin.png" align="left" style="width: 38%; height: 38%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;"> Tailoring the electrochromic property of WO<sub>3</sub> demands a stringent control of phase and morphology. 
						WO<sub>3</sub> exists in a myriad of crystallographic phases, and synthesizing it as a phase-pure material is a daunting task. 
						We have been able to synthesize phase-pure hexagonal and orthorhombic WO<sub>3</sub> by a simple hydrothermal process, through variation of capping agent. 
						The hexagonal phase shows a nanorod morphology, and the orthorhombic phase shows a plate morphology. 
						Energetics of capping calculated by DFT simulations complement the results as well. 
						In terms of properties, the two phases show very different coloration kinetics, which can be rationalized by simulations as well.
						Thus, with tailored chemistry rationalized by DFT simulations, a relationship between crystallographic structure and electrochromic property of nanoscale WO<sub>3</sub> can be established.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Adsorption Induced Semiconductor to Metal Transition in Tellurium Nanowires</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/tenw_s-m-ahin.jpg" align="left" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Semiconductor to metal (S-M) transition usually requires application of high pressure, or chemical/compositional transformation of materials. 
						In this paper, in contrast to the usual severe conditions, we show that ultrathin trigonal Te nanowires undergo  S-M transition upon simple adsorption of NO<sub>2</sub>. 
						This phenomenon was predicted by DFT calculations, as modeling of the adsorption process showed a band crossing across the Fermi-level upon NO<sub>2</sub> adsorption onto semiconducting Te nanowire. 
						Such striking prediction was verified by R-T measurements on the wet-chemically synthesized Te nanowires, wherein gradually increasing concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> on Te wires showed a slow change of the slope of R-T curve from negative to positive value.
						This has an implication on the gas sensing properties of Te nanowires, as our combined experiments and calculations clearly show that electronic band structure can be modulated by adsorption.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Negative Differential Resistance in Armchair Silicene Nanoribbons</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/ndr-paper.jpg" align="left" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Negative Differential Resistance (NDR) is a rare phenomenon in electronic devices. 
						Using DFT simulations coupled with non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF)- based electron transport, we show that 3n+2 armchair silicene nanoribbons is a potential candidate to show NDR. 
						The NDR can be explained from the basic electronic structure as-well. Thus, electronic transport calculation opens a possibility of novel electronic phenomena in 1D nanoribbons of silicene.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Wrinkling of Atomic Planes in Ultrathin Au nanowires</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/nl-paper.gif" align="left" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">A detailed understanding of structure and stability of nanowires is critical for applications. First-principles calculations of the [111]-oriented single-crystalline Au nanowires 
						predicts that the atoms in the close-packed atomic planes are displaced in the axial direction leading to wrinkling of the (111) planes.
						Atomic-resolution imaging of wet-chemically synthesized ultrathin single crystalline Au nanowires using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy
						confirms the prediction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that this is a size effect in nanoscale Au. With finite element modeling and solid mechanics arguments,
						we confirm that such wrinkling originates because of the dominating anisotropic surface stress of the bounding facets of the nanowire. This observation provides new understanding on the equilibrium structure of nanoscale systems 
						and could have important implications for applications in sensing and actuation.

					<p style="text-align:center; margin:0; width:100%; height: auto; color:white; background-color:Black"> Semiconductor-like Sensitivity in Metallic Ultrathin Au Nanowire Sensors</p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/research/jpc-c.gif" align="left" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; border: 2px solid black; margin: 0 30px 0px 0px;"/>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Owing to surface passivation, the sensitivity of semiconductor-based sensors deteriorates significantly at nanoscale. 
						Using simulations, we demonstrate semiconductor-like sensitivity toward chemical species in ultrathin single-crystalline gold nanowires.
						Detailed electronic structure calculations reveal that the sensing mechanism is governed by the modification of the electronic density of states in the Au nanowires. 
						Interestingly, the sensitivity exhibits a linear relationship with the electron affinities of the respective analytes, rendering a possibility of analyte-specific sensitivity.
